The city has a mix of ethnic Ukrainians and Russians, though Ukrainian identity has strengthened since 2014 due to the war.\n\n### **Context & Controversy**\n- The **122nd SS-Standarte** was one of several far-right groups that adopted **Nazi-inspired symbolism** (such as the **Totenkopf** skull and SS runes) during the conflict.\n- Some members were accused of **war crimes, extremism, and neo-Nazi ideology**, though Ukraine has officially distanced itself from such groups.\n- The **Azov Regiment** (which had far-right origins but was later integrated into Ukraine\u2019s National Guard) has been a particular focus of controversy, with Russia using its early Nazi-linked imagery as propaganda.\n\n### **Current Status**\n- The **122nd SS-Standarte** is not an active, recognized military unit today.\n- Ukraine has **banned Nazi symbolism** (including SS insignia) since 2015, and far-right groups have been marginalized in the military structure.\n- However, some extremist elements may still exist in fringe groups.\n\nWould you like more details on the historical SS divisions or the modern far-right scene in Ukraine?", "5ae7e1fc55429952e35ea9cc": "During **Oranjegekte** (Orange Craze) and **Koningsdag** (King's Day), people in the Netherlands wear **bright orange clothing** to celebrate the Dutch royal family, specifically the House of **Orange-Nassau** (*Oranje-Nassau*).\n\n### Why Orange?\n- The color **orange** (*oranje* in Dutch) symbolizes the royal family\u2019s name and heritage.\n- The tradition dates back to **William of Orange** (*Willem van Oranje*), the 16th-century leader of the Dutch Revolt against Spanish rule.\n- On **Koningsdag** (April 27, the king\u2019s birthday), the entire country turns orange with clothes, accessories, face paint, wigs, and decorations.\n\n### What Do People Wear?\n- **Orange shirts, dresses, hats, and socks**\n- **Orange wigs, boas, and face paint**\n- **Orange accessories** (sunglasses, beads, flags)\n- Some mix orange with **red, white, and blue** (the colors of the Dutch flag)\n\nEven pets, bikes, and food (like *oranjebitter* drinks and *tompouce* pastries) get the orange treatment!
