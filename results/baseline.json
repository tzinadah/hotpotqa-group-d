{"answer": {"5a8b57f25542995d1e6f1371": "No, Scott Derrickson and Ed Wood were not of the same nationality.\n\n- **Scott Derrickson** is an American filmmaker, born in **Birmingham, Alabama, USA**.\n- **Ed Wood** (Edward Davis Wood Jr.) was also an American filmmaker, born in **Poughkeepsie, New York, USA**.\n\nBoth were American, so they shared the same nationality. However, they were from different parts of the U.S. and worked in different eras (Wood in the 1950s\u201360s, Derrickson in the 1990s\u2013present).", "5a8c7595554299585d9e36b6": "The woman who portrayed Corliss Archer in the 1945 film *Kiss and Tell* was **Diana Lynn**. However, Diana Lynn did not hold any government position.\n\nIf you're referring to another actress who played Corliss Archer in a different adaptation (such as the 1950s TV series *Meet Corliss Archer*), the actress **Jean Parker** played the role in the 1947 film *The Perils of Pauline* (a parody), but she also did not hold a government position.\n\nIf you meant a different actress or context, please provide more details!", "5a85ea095542994775f606a8": "The series you're describing sounds like *The Locked Tomb* series by A. C. Wise, also known as *The Death of the Necromancer* series. However, the more likely match based on your description is *The Locked Tomb* series, which features a first-person narrator (Gideon the Ninth) and includes companion books that delve into the lore of the universe, including enslaved worlds and alien species.\n\nBut if you're thinking of a series with a more explicit focus on enslaved worlds and alien species, another possibility is *The Broken Earth* trilogy by N.K. Jemisin, though it's not strictly young adult and doesn't have companion books.\n\nAlternatively, you might be thinking of *The Fifth Season* (also by N.K. Jemisin), which has a richly detailed world with oppressed civilizations and unique species, though again, it's not YA.\n\nIf you're looking for a YA series with companion books about alien species and enslaved worlds, *The Illuminae Files* by Amie Kaufman and Jay Kristoff comes to mind, but it's not strictly first-person.\n\nCould you provide any additional details, like the protagonist's name, the setting, or any key plot points? That might help narrow it down!", "5adbf0a255429947ff17385a": "No, the **Laleli Mosque** and the **Esma Sultan Mansion** are not located in the same neighborhood in Istanbul.\n\n- **Laleli Mosque** is in the **Laleli** neighborhood, which is part of the **Fatih** district.\n- **Esma Sultan Mansion** (also known as **Esma Sultan Yal\u0131s\u0131**) is located in **K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck \u00c7aml\u0131ca**, within the **\u00dcsk\u00fcdar** district on the **Asian side** of Istanbul.\n\nWhile both are in Istanbul, they are on opposite sides of the Bosphorus and in different districts.", "5a8e3ea95542995a26add48d": "The director of *Big Stone Gap* (2014), **Adriana Trigiani**, is based in **New York City**.\n\nTrigiani, who also wrote the novel the film is based on, is a well-known author and filmmaker with strong ties to New York. While the movie itself is set in the small Appalachian town of Big Stone Gap, Virginia, Trigiani's professional and personal roots are in NYC.\n\nWould you like more details about the film or her career?"}}
