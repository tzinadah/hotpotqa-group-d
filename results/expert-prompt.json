He was born in **Poughkeepsie, New York, USA** (October 10, 1924).\n\n### **Answer:**\n**Yes, Scott Derrickson and Ed Wood were both American (of the same nationality).** Both were born in the United States, though in different eras and regions.", "5a8c7595554299585d9e36b6": "The woman who portrayed **Corliss Archer** in the 1945 film *Kiss and Tell* was **Shirley Temple**.\n\nAfter her acting career, Shirley Temple entered politics and served as the **United States Ambassador to Ghana** (1974\u20131976) and later as the **United States Ambassador to Czechoslovakia** (1989\u20131992) under President George H.

The Big 8 merged with the Southwest Conference (SWC) to form the **Big 12** in 1996.\n   - The Big 8 was part of the NCAA Division I (now FBS) from its inception in 1948.\n   - If we count 1948 as Year 1, then the 14th season would be **1961** (1948 + 13 years = 1961).\n2. **Big 12 Conference (1996\u20132010)**: Colorado joined the Big 12 in 1996 and left in 2010 for the Pac-12.\n   - The Big 12 was formed in 1996, so its 14th season would be **2009** (1996 + 13 = 2009).\n3. **Pac-12 Conference (2011\u2013present)**: Colorado joined the Pac-12 in 2011. The 14th season would be **2024** (2011 + 13 = 2024), but this is too recent and doesn't match the 2-6 record context.\n\n### Checking the 2-6 Conference Record:\nNow, let\u2019s see if Colorado had a 2-6 conference record in **1961 (Big 8)** or **2009 (Big 12)**.\n\n1. **1961 (Big 8)**:\n   - Colorado\u2019s record in 1961: 5-5 overall, **2-4 in Big 8 play** (not 2-6).\n   - Doesn\u2019t match.\n\n2. **2009 (Big 12)**:\n   - Colorado\u2019s record in 2009: 3-9 overall, **2-6 in Big 12 play**.\n   - This matches the 2-6 conference record!\n   - The Big 12 was in its 14th season in 2009 (1996\u20132009).\n\n### Verifying the Big 12's 14th Season:\n- The Big 12 was founded in 1996 (first season).\n- 1996 (1st), 1997 (2nd), ..., 2009 (14th).\n- So 2009 is indeed the 14th season.\n\n### Other Possibilities:\n- Could it be another conference? The Big 8\u2019s 14th season was 1961, but the record doesn\u2019t match.\n- The Pac-12\u2019s 14th season is 2024, which is too recent and doesn\u2019t fit.\n- No other conferences fit the timeline and record.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only year and conference that fit all the clues are:\n- **Year**: 2009\n- **Conference**: Big 12 (14th season as part of NCAA Division I/FBS)\n- **Record**: 2-6 in conference play.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe 14th season for the **Big 12 Conference** as part of NCAA Division I/FBS was **2009**, when the Colorado Buffaloes had a **2-6 conference record**.", "5ab84bf555429916710eb01f": "The chain that bought **Euromarch\u00e9** in 1991 was **Carrefour**, the French multinational retail giant.\n\nAt the end of **2016**, Carrefour operated **1,452 hypermarkets** worldwide (under its various banners, including Carrefour Hypermarkets, Champion, and others).\n\n### Breakdown (2016 figures):\n- **France**: ~220 hypermarkets\n- **Europe (excluding France)**: ~500+\n- **Latin America, Asia, Africa, Middle East**: ~700+\n\nCarrefour had been expanding aggressively in emerging markets (e.g., Brazil, China, and the Middle East) while rationalizing its European footprint.\n\n*(Source: Carrefour Annual Reports, 2016 financial disclosures, and retail industry analyses.)*", "5a77724455429972597f153e": "The race track you're referring to is the **Indianapolis Motor Speedway** in **Speedway, Indiana** (part of the Indianapolis metropolitan area).\n\nThis iconic track hosts the **Indianapolis 500**, a 500-mile (800 km) open-wheel race held annually on **Memorial Day weekend** (typically the last Sunday in May).

Comparison: Are They the Same Level?**\n| **Criteria**       | **Yingkou**               | **Fuding**                |\n|--------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| **Administrative Level** | Prefecture-level city (\u5730\u7ea7\u5e02) | County-level city (\u53bf\u7ea7\u5e02) |\n| **Governance**     | Governs districts/cities  | Governed by Ningde (prefecture-level) |\n| **Hierarchy**      | Higher (same as Ningde)   | Lower (like a \"sub-city\") |\n| **Example Peers**  | Dalian, Shenyang          | Fuqing, Longhai           |\n\n**Conclusion**: **No, they are not the same level**.\n- Yingkou is a **prefecture-level city** (like Ningde, Fuding\u2019s superior).\n- Fuding is a **county-level city** (like Dashiqiao, which is *under* Yingkou).\n\n---\n\n### **5. Why the Confusion?**\n- Both are called \"cities\" (\u5e02 *sh\u00ec*), but China\u2019s system has **two tiers of cities**.\n- Some county-level cities (e.g., Fuding, Kunshan) are economically strong but still administratively subordinate.\n- Yingkou is **larger in both area and governance scope** (it manages other county-level cities).\n\n---\n### **6. Analogy**\nThink of it like:\n- **Yingkou** = A **state** (e.g., California) with its own counties/cities.\n- **Fuding** = A **city** (e.g., Santa Barbara) within a county, which is part of that state.\n\n---\n### **7. Extra Trivia**\n- **Fuding** is famous for its **white tea** and **Haitan Island** (a tourist spot).\n- **Yingkou** is one of China\u2019s earliest treaty ports (opened in 1858) and has a historic **French concession area**.\n- China has **293 prefecture-level cities** but **~3,000+ county-level divisions** (including county-level cities).\n\nWould you like details on their economic rankings or historical roles?"}, "sp": {"5a8b57f25542995d1e6f1371": [], "5a8c7595554299585d9e36b6": [], "5a85ea095542994775f606a8": [], "5adbf0a255429947ff17385a": [], "5a8e3ea95542995a26add48d": [], "5abd94525542992ac4f382d2": [], "5a85b2d95542997b5ce40028": [], "5a87ab905542996e4f3088c1": [], "5a7bbb64554299042af8f7cc": [], "5a8db19d5542994ba4e3dd00": [], "5a7166395542994082a3e814": [], "5a877e5d5542993e715abf7d": [], "5ab3b0bf5542992ade7c6e39": [], "5ab56e32554299637185c594": [], "5ab6d09255429954757d337d": [], "5a75e05c55429976ec32bc5f": [], "5ab3e45655429976abd1bcd4": [], "5ab29c24554299449642c932": [], "5ae0d4c9554299603e418468": [], "5a8133725542995ce29dcbdb": [], "5ae7a8175542993210983ed8": [], "5ae6050f55429929b0807a5e": [], "5adddccd5542997dc7907069": [], "5ae2070a5542994d89d5b313": [], "5ae22b8d554299234fd0440f": [], "5a722b8655429971e9dc9329": [], "5adf37a95542995ec70e8f97": [], "5abd259d55429924427fcf1a": [], "5a828c8355429966c78a6a50": [], "5a8a3e745542996c9b8d5e70": [], "5ac23ff0554299636651994d": [], "5ae4a3265542995ad6573de5": [], "5ae0361155429925eb1afc2c": [], "5abc0a5d5542993f40c73c64": [], "5a7cc50e554299452d57ba3e": [], "5abf63f15542997ec76fd3ea": [], "5a8ef2a75542995a26add583": [], "5a80721b554299485f5985ef": [], "5ab51dae5542991779162d82": [], "5a7571135542992d0ec05f98": [], "5a7a0e1e5542990783324e1a": [], "5a74106b55429979e288289e": [], "5a79311755429970f5fffe67": [], "5ab2d3df554299194fa9352c": [], "5a760ab65542994ccc918697": [], "5a7d54165542995f4f402256": [], "5ab859a955429934fafe6d7b": [], "5add61d65542995b365fab21": [], "5a8e068b5542995085b37384": [], "5abbf698554299114383a0b5": [], "5a8e1027554299653c1aa15f": [], "5ab84bf555429916710eb01f": [], "5a77724455429972597f153e": [], "5a87c13f5542996e4f30890c": [], "5ab96ab755429970cfb8eacd": [], "5a8a43eb5542996c9b8d5e82": [], "5ae73acb5542991e8301cc07": [], "5a7320565542991f9a20c61d": [], "5ae32e125542991a06ce9946": [], "5adc53f75542996e6852530a": [], "5a8b20335542996c9b8d5fb3": [], "5a85fb085542994775f606de": [], "5a7be2595542997c3ec972ac": [], "5a77152355429966f1a36c2e": [], "5a8f4c8d554299458435d5a3": [], "5a80840f554299485f59863b": [], "5a8361b65542992ef85e22a0": [], "5ae7ba7a5542993210983f12": [], "5ac2acff55429921a00ab02b": [], "5aba7cfe554299232ef4a2fd": [], "5ae5aba0554299546bf82f17": [], "5ae1f4cb554299234fd0436d": [], "5ae7e1fc55429952e35ea9cc": [], "5ae37c765542992f92d822d4": [], "5ae33c4d5542992f92d82262": [], "5a77cb335542997042120b3a": [], "5a8979f4554299669944a52e": [], "5a713ea95542994082a3e6e4": [], "5a78bd9b554299078472774a": [], "5a7625e8554299109176e66a": [], "5ae2dd2055429928c423950d": [], "5abdf12255429976d4830a2f": [], "5a88658955429938390d3f47": [], "5a86ebac55429960ec39b6d6": [], "5aba5d2e55429901930fa799": [], "5ae5736e5542990ba0bbb2b3": [], "5ae005b555429942ec259bec": [], "5a7759fc5542993569682d60": [], "5a835478554299123d8c20ed": [], "5aba749055429901930fa7d8": [], "5abfb3425542990832d3a1c0": [], "5ac3165c5542995ef918c10a": [], "5ae53b545542990ba0bbb23c": [], "5ae224da554299234fd043ee": [], "5ae2b770554299495565db0f": [], "5a80b3a9554299485f5986cc": [], "5a8e0a005542995085b373a1": [], "5ac1b8ee5542994d76dccedc": [], "5adccd795542990d50227d2c": [], "5a84c4135542994c784dda31": []}}
